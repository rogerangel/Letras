            "We are partnering with two schools in the city of San Francisco de Macoris, Dominican Republic - Escuela Julio Plata De La Rosa in Guiza, and Escuela Maximo Gomez in Mata Larga - to create school and community libraries in the Fall of 2024. Communication with school leaders and active community members have identified these institutions not only as having a high need for literacy materials and resources, but as institutions with a strong desire to improve the academic learning of their students by promoting literacy, learning, and community engagement.",
            "Multiple site visits to the elementary schools expose an inadequate amount of books needed to foster a literacy rich environment for students in a literacy-rich environment. Their classroom libraries mainly consist of textbooks, many of which are outdated. Of the few literature books that exist throughout their classrooms, many are in poor condition, do not match the grade level of the students, and are confined to a narrow set of genres and perspectives. Currently, the educational resources available for the 0-5 age range are nonexistent. The Mata Larga and Guiza community does not have any pre-k programs, childcare centers, or children's books available.",

            "Together with key school and community members, Letras Inc. will strengthen the literacy cultures within both partner schools in San Francisco de Macoris. Letras will donate culturally relevant books to supplement their existing reading programs (i.e. Leer es divertido & Ama leer / Reading is fun & Love reading). Because the schools begin teaching English in the fourth grade, literature donated for grades 4-8 will include Spanish and Bilingual texts. Through a donation of books and school materials, Letras Inc. hopes to revitalize each school’s culture of literacy and empower its students and community on the road to educational and career success. Informing the community of the importance of literacy helps build attitudes, habits, and confidence around reading. Additionally, the libraries will include a community component where families from surrounding neighborhoods are able to access books and engage their children who are not yet school-age. A donation of early childhood literacy books will complement the school libraries and set a foundation of learning for children preparing to enter school.",
